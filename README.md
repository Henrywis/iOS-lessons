## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
**Instagram**

**WhatsApp**
- Changing the background color and the Theme of the messages screen
- Uploading and updating status posts
- Archiving chats

**Spatial**

- Reactions like clap, dance, et.c 

**EXISTING APP MODIFICATION**
- A recruiting website strictly for students from underrepresented communities, where users (students) can apply for internships, have personal profiles and get recommendations based on the user interactions and is scaled using memcached.
- I would like to make a mobile version of this app, I already built the desktop version.

## Notes
